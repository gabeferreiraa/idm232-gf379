            <h2>The Approach</h2>
            <h3>User-Centric Design &amp; Agile Development</h3>
            <p>To tackle the challenges, we adopted a user-centric design philosophy combined with agile development methodologies. Our approach included:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>User Research &amp; Personas:</strong> Conducted surveys and interviews to understand user behaviors, preferences, and pain points. Developed detailed user personas to guide design decisions.</li>
                <li><strong>Wireframing &amp; Prototyping:</strong> Created low-fidelity wireframes to map out the user journey and key functionalities. Developed high-fidelity prototypes using tools like Figma to visualize the final design.</li>
                <li><strong>Iterative Testing &amp; Feedback:</strong> Implemented usability testing sessions to gather real-time feedback. Iterated on designs based on user insights to enhance usability and satisfaction.</li>
