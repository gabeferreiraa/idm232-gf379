"37","Top Chef Ginger-Marinated Grassfed Steaks","with Stir-Fried Vegetables &amp; Jasmine Rice","Seasonal","Steak","45 min","740 Cals","2 Servings","In this recipe inspired by our Quickfire Challenge from Top Chef Season 15 on Bravo we're marinating grassfed steaks in fresh ginger, soy sauce, and citrusy ponzu sauce. The extra marinade transforms into an easy pan sauce, which adds punchy flavor to the steaks and a side of jasmine rice.","2 Grassfed Steaks*3 oz Radishes*4 oz Cremini Mushrooms*3/4 cup Jasmine Rice*1/2 lb Baby Bok Choy*1 Shallot*1 Tbsp Sugar*1 1-Inch Piece Ginger*1 Tbsp Ponzu Sauce*1 Bird's Eye Chile Pepper*1 Tbsp Rice Vinegar*1 Tbsp Soy Sauce","Marinate the steaks ^^ Peel and finely chop the ginger. Place in a medium bowl. Stir in the soy sauce, ponzu sauce, and a drizzle of olive oil. Pat the steaks dry with paper towels; season with salt and pepper on both sides. Place in the bowl of marinade and turn to coat. Set aside to marinate, turning occasionally, for at least 10 minutes.*Cook the rice ^^ While the steaks marinate, in a medium pot, combine the rice, a big pinch of salt, and 1 1/2 cups of water. Heat to boiling on high. Once boiling, cover and reduce the heat to low. Cook 12 to 14 minutes, or until the water has been absorbed and the rice is tender. Turn off the heat and fluff with a fork. Cover to keep warm.*Prepare the ingredients ^^ While the rice cooks, wash and dry the fresh produce. Quarter the mushrooms. Peel and thinly slice the shallot. Cut off and discard the root end of the bok choy; roughly chop. Cut off and discard the ends of the radishes; thinly slice into rounds. Place in a bowl. Top with half the vinegar; season with salt and pepper. Set aside to marinate, stirring occasionally, for at least 10 minutes. Cut off and discard the stem end of the pepper; thinly slice crosswise. (For a milder dish, remove and discard the seeds first.) Thoroughly wash your hands, knife, and cutting board immediately after handling.*Cook the vegetables ^^ In a medium pan, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the quartered mushrooms in an even layer. Cook, without stirring, 2 to 3 minutes, or until lightly browned. Add the sliced shallot, chopped bok choy, and as much of the sliced pepper as you'd like, depending on how spicy you'd like the dish to be; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, 2 to 3 minutes, or until softened. Transfer to a bowl. Stir in the remaining vinegar; season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover with aluminum foil. Rinse and wipe out the pan.*Cook the steaks ^^ In the same pan, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Reserving the marinade, add the marinated steaks. Cook, turning occasionally, 7 to 9 minutes for medium-rare, or until browned and cooked to your desired degree of doneness. Leaving any browned bits (or fond) in the pan, transfer to a cutting board and let rest for at least 5 minutes.*Make the sauce & serve your dish ^^ While the steaks rest, to the pan of reserved fond, add the reserved marinade, sugar, and 1/4 cup of water (be careful, as the liquid may splatter). Bring to a boil on medium-high. Cook, stirring constantly, 2 to 3 minutes, or until thickened. Turn off the heat and season with salt and pepper to taste. Find the lines of muscle (or grain) on the rested steaks; thinly slice crosswise against the grain. Serve the sliced steaks with the cooked rice and cooked vegetables. Top the steaks with the sauce. Garnish with the marinated radishes (draining before adding).
